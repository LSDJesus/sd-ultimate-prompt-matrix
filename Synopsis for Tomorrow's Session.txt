Synopsis for Tomorrow's Session
Project: ultimate_prompt_matrix_ext.py, a comprehensive grid generation extension for AUTOMATIC1111/Forge.
Current Status: Finalizing Test Case #1. We have been battling a persistent, critical stability bug where the core StableDiffusionProcessing object becomes corrupted after being used, causing silent crashes. We believe we have the definitive solution.
The Proposed Fix (Untested): The latest version of the script implements a robust two-part architecture to prevent state corruption:
Generation Loop: A brand new, pristine processing object (p_job) is created from scratch for every single image generation, ensuring complete isolation between jobs.
Grid Saving: A temporary processing object (p_temp), which is created at the start of the run but never used for generation, provides clean metadata for saving the final grid images, preventing a crash at the very end of the process.
Immediate Next Step: Run the provided final script against Test Case #1 one more time. If it completes successfully (generates all 8 images and the final grids without crashing), Test Case #1 is officially complete, and we can proceed to Test Case #2.
Verbose Test Plan (Remaining Cases)
The goal of these next two test cases is to systematically validate every remaining feature, focusing on how they interact with each other to uncover potential edge cases.
Test Case #2: LoRA, Checkpoints, and Presets
Objective: Validate the LoRA Matrix Builder, the <checkpoint(...)> parameter, the preset Save/Load system, and the "Show grid labels" toggle. This test stresses string generation, major state changes (model reloads), and full UI state management.
Setup:
Requires at least two different checkpoint models (e.g., dreamshaper_8.safetensors, v1-5-pruned-emaonly.safetensors).
Requires at least two different LoRAs.
In the UI, set Seed Behavior to Fixed.
In Grid & File Settings, uncheck Show grid labels & titles.
Verbose Procedure:
Build LoRA Matrix: Navigate to the "LoRA Matrix Builder". Click "Add LoRA Block". In the first block, select one LoRA. In the second block, select a different LoRA. Click the "Insert LoRA Matrix" button. The prompt should now contain a complex string like <a photo of a man <lora:lora_A:1.0>|<lora:lora_B:1.0>>.
Add Checkpoint Matrix: Manually append a checkpoint matrix to the prompt. The final prompt should look something like: <a photo of a man <lora:lora_A:1.0>|<lora:lora_B:1.0>>, <checkpoint(dreamshaper_8.safetensors|v1-5-pruned-emaonly.safetensors)>. (Use your actual model filenames).
Save Preset: Navigate to "Preset Management". In the "Save as Preset" box, type a name like LoRA vs Checkpoint Test. Click Save.
Validate Preset Load:
Click the "üóëÔ∏è" button to clear the prompt.
Change the "Sampling method" to something different (e.g., DPM++ SDE Karras).
From the "Load Preset" dropdown, select the LoRA vs Checkpoint Test preset you just saved.
Expected Outcome (Preset): Verify that the full prompt is restored, the sampling method is changed back, the "Seed Behavior" is Fixed, and the "Show grid labels & titles" box is unchecked.
Generate & Verify: Click Generate.
Expected Outcome (Generation): A single 2x2 grid image should be produced. The grid itself should have no text annotations (no titles, no X/Y labels). The console/terminal should show messages indicating that the model was reloaded during the process. The infotext for the images in the grid should confirm that different LoRAs and different checkpoints were used for each quadrant.
Test Case #3: Sandbox, Wildcards, and Final Checks
Objective: Validate the "Single Prompt Sandbox", compatibility with the Dynamic Prompts extension (wildcards), the accuracy of the time calculator, and the "Paste Last Prompts" utility button.
Setup:
Requires the sd-dynamic-prompts extension to be active.
Create a file named subjects.txt in your extensions/sd-dynamic-prompts/wildcards directory.
The content of subjects.txt should be:
Generated code
a knight
a wizard
an astronaut
Use code with caution.
Verbose Procedure:
Sandbox Speed Test: Open the "Single Prompt Sandbox" accordion. Leave the default prompt. Click "Generate Test Image".
Update Calculator: A log will appear like Generated in 5.12s. Take this number (e.g., 5.12) and enter it into the "Time for 512x512 (s)" input box in the main UI.
Wildcard Prompt: In the main prompt box, enter: a full-body photo of __subjects__, <fantasy|sci-fi> armor.
Pre-process & Verify: Click "Pre-process & Calculate". Verify that the "Total Images" reports 6 (3 subjects √ó 2 armor types) and that the estimated time seems correct based on your input.
Generate & Verify: Click Generate.
Expected Outcome (Generation): A 2x3 grid should be created. The axes should correspond to the wildcard values (a knight, a wizard, an astronaut) and the armor types (fantasy, sci-fi).
Paste Last Prompt Test: After generation is complete, click the "üóëÔ∏è" button to clear the prompt box. Then click the "‚ÜôÔ∏è Paste Last Prompts" button.
Expected Outcome (Paste): The prompt box should be populated with the resolved prompt from one of the generated images (e.g., a full-body photo of an astronaut, fantasy armor), not the raw prompt containing __subjects__.
